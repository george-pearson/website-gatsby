          Hi I'm George. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer working in the UK. I
          graduated from the University of Oxford in Chemistry in 2016, but
          quickly switched from science to software after that. I mostly use
          C#, SQL, JavaScript and a bit of Python at work. I'm always
          interested in learning new things so don't hesitate to <a className="blueLink" href="mailto:george-pearson.business@outlook.com">reach out!</a> ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
      </div>
    </Layout>
