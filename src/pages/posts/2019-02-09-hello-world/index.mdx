I've finally shipped! After about a month of what seems like going backwards and forwards I've made my first post on my brand new website. I‚Äôm going to try and do at least one post a month, and I plan to keep them relatively short. I can‚Äôt promise they won‚Äôt end up longer though if I really get into it!

## Jekyll and GitHub Pages

So you want to know how I made this site right? Well initially I was thinking of using what I know from work - C# <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc" class="blueLink">ASP.NET MVC</a>. But I figured it would be better if I learnt something new and all that server side setup and maintenance seemed like a pain. After a recommendation from a friend I found that GitHub offers **free hosting** for websites running <a class="blueLink" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. This seemed perfect for what I needed and no server side hassle! From GitHub Pages I was directed to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="blueLink">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is an amazing open source blogging tool, which among other things has inbuilt support for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="blueLink">Markdown</a> making writing blog posts a breeze[^1].

Here's an example of the JavaScript markdown which uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pygments/" class="blueLink">Pygments</a>:

```javascript
(function() {
  console.log("Hello World! üòä");
})();
```

Jekyll also has a great HTML templating through use of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/" class="blueLink">includes</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/" class="blueLink">layouts</a> which help keep your project well structured.

## Sass and Gulp

At work we predominantly use CSS libraries like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" class="blueLink">Bootstrap</a>, but one thing I decided fairly early on was that I was going to develop all the CSS myself to improve my front-end skills. After a bit of online research I decided I was going to use the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" class="blueLink">Sass</a> CSS templating language. Here's the Sass for those crazy blue links:

```scss
$color--skyblue: #00c1c1;
$color--white: #fff;

%transition-duration {
  transition-duration: 0.5s;
}

.blueLink,
%blueLink {
  color: $color--skyblue;
  text-decoration: none;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to top,
    $color--skyblue,
    $color--skyblue 50%,
    transparent 50%,
    transparent
  );
  background-position: 0% 0%;
  background-size: 100% 200%;
  @extend %transition-duration;

  &:hover {
    color: $color--white;
    background-position: 0 100%;
  }
}
```

Sass makes your CSS code simpler with things like variables `$color--skyblue`, placeholder selectors `%transition-duration` and parent selectors `&:hover`. Essentially Sass means you don't have to repeat yourself so often!

While investigating Sass I was directed to <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" class="blueLink">Gulp</a> a DevOps build tool. Gulp essentially allows you to automate command line tools for things like:

- Compiling Sass files to CSS when they change.
- Minifying JavaScript and CSS files.
- Running a Jekyll build when a markdown file is updated.
- Reloading your browser once a build is complete.

This makes development a lot easier and faster. Here's an example of a gulp command that compiles a Sass file and minifies the outputed CSS:

```javascript
/**
 * Compile .scss files.
 */
gulp.task("sass", function() {
  return gulp
    .src("_scss/main.scss")
    .pipe(sass().on("error", sass.logError))
    .pipe(cssnano())
    .pipe(rename("main.min.css"))
    .pipe(gulp.dest("assets/css/"));
});
```

## Photos

<div className={commonStyle.halfWidthContainer}>
  <div className={commonStyle.halfWidthLeft}>
    <img style={{ width: "100%" }} src={sunset} alt="sunset" />
  </div>
  <div className={commonStyle.halfWidthRight}>
    <p>
      One thing I thought I'd share on this blog is
      some <a class="blueLink" href="/Photos">photos</a> I've
      taken on my travels. In the future I'd like to develop that
      area into a gallery of some kind. The photos have been compressed
      using <a class="blueLink" href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> making
      them take up less space and load quickly (hopefully).
    </p>
  </div>

## Conclusion

In fact creating this website was a lot easier than I imagined thanks to all the great freely available open source tools on the web. Now that I started writing about some of these tools I realised most of them probably need an entire post to be explained with any detail. So I might be doing some "idiots guide to..." posts in the near future. Anyhow hope you enjoyed my first post and are looking forward to the next instalment. üòè
