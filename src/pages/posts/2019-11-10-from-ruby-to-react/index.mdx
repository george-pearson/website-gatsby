I recently migrated my blog from one static site generator, <a class="blueLink" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
to another, <a class="blueLink" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>. 
A static site generator is a tool that allows you to generate static HTML from templates
which can then easily be served up to clients making a simple website. Here are a few
reasons I did this:

- Jekyll runs using <a class="blueLink" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, which is pretty old
and <a class="blueLink" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">not that popular</a>.
- Gatsby runs using <a class="blueLink" href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a> which is more modern and well supported.
- Gatsby uses <a class="blueLink" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> a popular UI framework I wanted to learn.
- Gatsby has many easy to use plugins that are available on 
<a class="blueLink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>.
- Gatsby uses <a class="blueLink" href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> an
easy to use build tool which doesn't require build scripts (I was using <a class="blueLink" href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> previously).

## Initial setup

One of the immediate benefits I found was how easy it is to get Gatsby up and
running compared to Jekyll (webpack is great!).
Additionally <a class="blueLink" href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Code Splitting</a> allowed
me to simplify my old sites <a class="blueLink" href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> into
smaller chunks of plain old CSS.

## Offline support

<div className={commonStyle.halfWidthContainer}>
  <div className={commonStyle.halfWidthLeft}>
    <img style={{marginTop: '20px'}} height="320px" width="180px" src={offlineApp} alt="offlineApp" />
  </div>
  <div className={commonStyle.halfWidthRight}>
    <p>
      Adding offline support was super easy! There are just two simple <a class="blueLink" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-offline-support-with-a-service-worker/">Gatsby plugins</a> to install and you're away. This allows users to download your site content as an application which can be viewed offline. Try it out on mobile - its pretty cool! ðŸ˜ƒ

  </div>

## React and MDX 

I wanted to convert the various JavaScript tools I made in previous blog posts into reusable 
React <a class="blueLink" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">components</a>, written
in JSX (the React template language). To add these components to my markdown posts I
used <a class="blueLink" href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> a markdown extension format that includes
JSX. This worked relatively well and I was able to refactor all of my JavaScript code to React,
learning lots of React concepts!

## Other stuff

As well as the migration I also:

- Added a slide bar for mobile devices making the mobile experience a lot nicer.
- Simplified all SVGs and used <a class="blueLink" href="https://github.com/jacobmischka/gatsby-plugin-react-svg">gatsby-plugin-react-svg</a> to
add them into JSX easily.
- Improved the home page paginator to have page numbers, rather than just a "Next Page" button.

## All still on GitHub

Finally all of my website code is still hosted on <a class="blueLink" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, free for anyone to look at!
